2. `Compiling_figures.r`

It accompanies the manuscript:

**Pinceel, T., Buschke, F.T., Weckx, M., Brendonck, L. & Vanschoenwinkel, B. (Unpublished) Climate change jeopardises demographic resilience in a freshwater zooplankton species.**

More information can be obtained from the manuscript, which can be requested from `falko.buschke@gmail.com`

## Stochastic_bet-hedging.r
This fully annotated script includes all the functions to simulate the population demographics under a suite of hydological regimes.

## Compiling_figures.r
This fully annotated script includes all the functions to plot how changes in demographic rates affect the population growth rates and extinction probability across a range of hydrological regimes. This script also includes the demographic rates measured during the laboratory climate change experiment.
